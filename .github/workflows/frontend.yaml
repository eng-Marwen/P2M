# B. Continuous Integration (CI) — Testing & Validation

# Ensure the code works and is high quality before deployment.

# Common steps:

# Checkout code (clone the repo)

# Set up environment (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)

# Install dependencies

# Run tests (unit, integration, end-to-end)

# Optional:

# Linting / code formatting check

# Static type checks (TypeScript)

# Security audit (npm audit)

# Test coverage check

# ✅ Goal: catch issues early.

# C. Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD) — Build & Deploy

# Get the code live automatically if CI passes.

# Common steps:

# Build artifacts (Docker image, binary, zip, etc.)

# Tag version (semantic version + commit SHA)

# Push artifact (Docker registry, package manager)

# Deploy to target environment:

# Cloud service (Render, Railway, Fly.io)

# Kubernetes cluster

# Serverless platform
